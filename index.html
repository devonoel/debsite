        <h2>Deb McIntosh - A Community Leader for Ward 9</h2>

        <p>
          As the current Ward 9 city councillor, Deb McIntosh has 
          <span class="bold">demonstrated over the past eight years</span> 
          that she <span class="bold">works effectively</span> with residents,
          business and community groups, and all levels of government to
          <span class="bold">get things done</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Deb extended the <span class="bold">fiscal responsibility</span> and 
          <span class="bold">high achievement level</span> she demonstrated
          during her career in Sudbury as an accountant, community volunteer
          and Executive Director of Rainbow Routes Association 
          <span class="bold">into her work as a councillor</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since 2014, Ward 9 residents have appreciated Deb's 
          <span class="bold">ability to listen</span> to their concerns, help
          them <span class="bold">come up with new and alternative approaches</span> 
          to projects or concerns, and be the first to pitch in to 
          <span class="bold">make things happen</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Deb is <span class="bold">committed</span> to using her experience on
          city council and committees to work for Ward 9. She will continue to
          be <span class="bold">responsive</span> to the ward's needs and
          interests. At the same time, Deb will put her <span class="bold">energy</span> 
          and <span class="bold">critical thinking skills</span> into
          <span class="bold">collaborating</span> on projects that will
          benefit the city as a whole.

          One of the best things about being a city councillor is getting to know and
          work with the people in Ward 9. It is very gratifying to have worked together
          on community issues and projects, and I am motivated to continuing that
          work for another term.

        <h2>Our community -- Our future</h2>

        <h3>Deb's pledge to Ward 9: 2022-26</h3>
        <p>
          When Deb ran for the Ward 9 council seat in 2014, she promised to work hard. She
          laid out a four-part platform that would inform her decision making over the term
          of council.
        </p>

        <p>
          Deb has kept this promise, and has worked tirelessly and collaboratively with many
          constituents, local businesses and City Council to improve the quality of life in Ward
          9 and the City of Greater Sudbury.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the next term of council, armed with the knowledge gained over the past eight
          years, Deb promises to continue working hard and make decisions based on a
          similar platform: fostering economic growth, protecting water, championing smart
          transportation and demonstrating good governance.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Double the annual investment in our city's 3600 lane kilometres of roads and
                  bridges since 2014 (but more must be done)
                </li>

                <li>
                  Provide improved and more efficient services: more online services; a One
                  Stop Shop at City Hall; more road and bridge work; more sidewalk and
                  cycling spaces; a new GOVA transit system (which saw a 23% increase in
                  ridership between 2020-2021); replacement of 100-year old pipes and
                  installation of new digital water meters; new LED street lights throughout the

                  Attract new residents through economic development initiatives and the

                  levels of unemployment and a population density rate of only 53 people per
                  square kilometre living in the largest municipality by area in Ontario, this is
                  crucial to our city's future success.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Make the changes necessary to permit and encourage small and tiny homes.

        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h2>Why are you running for re-election?</h2>
          <p>Council launched several initiatives during our last term that I would like to see through to completion. I'd also like to initiate other projects related to my platform priorities.  (See the "Priorities" tab on this web page for further details.)</p>

          <p>Being a City Councillor is first and foremost an opportunity for public service. During my first term on council I have enjoyed working with residents throughout Ward 9 on a range of exciting community projects. I was also able to help many individual residents in their dealings with the municipality. Through all of this I have learned a great deal, and hope to have the opportunity to apply that knowledge in the next term to accomplish even more, working for and with the citizens of Greater Sudbury.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h2>In your opinion, what are the most pressing issues that still need to be tackled?</h2>
          <p>Short answer: Old roads, pipes, buildings and vehicles.</p>

          <p>We need to continue to address our infrastructure investment shortfall. We have to repair or replace aging infrastructure, and that will require serious investments of time, energy and dollars.</p>

          <p>We have several options, including raising taxes, reducing the level of services we provide, continuing to work on reducing inefficiencies and increasing the number of people sharing the cost of running the city.</p>

          <p>Long-term success will require efforts in all four areas: we need to regularly review our service levels and how we deliver them; we need to support the growth of existing Sudbury businesses while enticing new business and talent to invest here; and we need to apply moderate tax increases as necessary to keep the city moving forward.</p>

          <p>The ongoing balancing of services and expenditures takes considered effort. To grow our economy, we must make investments and offer incentives in the right areas at the right time in an effort to create an environment that will attract and keep businesses and jobs here.  A growing economy, along with moderate tax increases and adjusted service levels and/or more efficient delivery, enables us to chip away at fixing roads, replacing pipes and city-owned vehicles, and renovating or replacing buildings past their best-before date.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h2>What is an acceptable tax increase?</h2>
          <p>Nobody likes tax increases - what is an acceptable increase to one person will not be acceptable to another. However, our property taxes pay for important emergency services (police, fire, paramedic), roads, waste collection, parks, pools, libraries etc.</p>

          <p>To maintain our current service levels we need to increase taxes every year. It would be ideal to keep that increase to the rate of inflation, with the knowledge that some costs rise faster than the rate of inflation eg energy costs.</p>

          <p>To properly tackle our infrastructure shortfall (see above) we may want to look at increasing taxes a bit above the inflation rate through a special capital levy to replace/renew roads, pipes and buildings. I'd like to hear your thoughts on that idea.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h2>What is your position on the Sudbury Community Arena?</h2>

          <p>
            We still have a 70-year old arena that has needed expensive emergency repairs,
            and was not built for the types of sporting and entertainment experiences that
            people want these days.
          </p>

          <p>
            I would very much like to hear from you with your thoughts on what we should do
            at deb@debmcintosh.ca
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h2>Why does Council seem to meet in closed session so often?</h2>

          <p>
            I don't think anyone on Council likes going into closed session, but sometimes we
            have to in order to protect the municipality/corporation.
          </p>

          <p>
            We go into closed to get legal advice, to buy, sell or lease property or discuss
            personnel issues including contract negotiations with the City's unions. The City
            Clerk is in attendance at all meetings and works to keep us "on topic".

            can share your concerns with the
